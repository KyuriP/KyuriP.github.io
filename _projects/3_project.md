With Dr. <a href="https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/">Erik-Jan van Kesteren</a>, I worked on making a R package called `synthpop.extract`. It aims to help establishing a stable procedure for exporting synthetic datasets based on real data at Statistics Netherlands <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb">(CBS)</a>.
