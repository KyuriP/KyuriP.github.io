Recently I cleaned out my closet and found a bunch I wouldn't wear.
Then, I thought: "why don't I try making clothes for my dogs?" 
I instantly looked up D.I.Y. dog clothes on the Internet, and followed the Wikihow "Easy and Fun DIY Dog Outfts"
Well....
Now that I look back, I was being silly. 
It was so much more difficult than it seemed. 
Although the clothes didn't turn out pretty, my dogs didn't seem to hate them.
Maybe I will give it another go some day! :wink:
