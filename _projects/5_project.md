In the past couple of months, I've embarked on an exhilarating coffee adventure at a campus cafe :coffee:.   
It has been an absolute blast working behind the bar, chatting with customers, learning how to steam milk and do latte art (let's just say it's a work in progress, but I'm improving every day, haha).  
Cheers to the amazing Gutenberg crews who have granted me this wonderful opportunity!
