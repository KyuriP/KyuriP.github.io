As a final project for the <a href="https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2022-2023-en/search-course/course/102117">Network Analysis</a> course, I together with Shannon worked on a cool mini-project about comparing Gaussian graphical models (GGM) with directed cyclic graph (DCG) models: how do they perform as causal discovery tools?

See below for our poster, and a supplementary material is also available <a href = "https://rpubs.com/KyuriP/GGMandDCG">here</a>.
