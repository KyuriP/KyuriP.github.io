<h3>Bio</h3>
I am a 2nd year Master's student in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences <a href='https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences'>(MSBSS)</a> at <a href='https://www.uu.nl'>Utrehct University</a>.
Currently, I am working as a student assistant for the Human Data Science group <a href='https://hds.sites.uu.nl/'>(HDS)</a> at Utrehct University. As part of my thesis project, I am working on causal modeling (e.g., cyclic causal models, causal discovery algorithms) together with Dr. <a href='https://oisinryan.org/'>Ois√≠n Ryan</a>.
<br>
<br>
I previously studied <a href = "https://psyres.uva.nl/content/research-groups/programme-group-psychological-methods/programme-group-psychological-methods.html?cb">Psychological Methods </a> at <a href = "https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>, where I first leanred about psychometrics, formal modeling of human cognition, and Bayesian modelling framework. For my thesis, I investigated the effects of integrating varaiables operating on different time scales into a single network model on network density, under the supervision of Prof. dr. <a href='https://dennyborsboom.com/'>Denny Borsboom</a>. and Dr. <a href='https://cvborkulo.com/'>Claudia van Borkulo</a>.
<br>
<br>
Besides academic stuff, I love having a good cup of coffee, traveling, taking photos, and walking in bos (forest) with my dogs. I'm not a professional photographer of course, but I love taking photos wherever I travel or just any random things in my everyday life.
