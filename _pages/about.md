<h3>Bio</h3>
I am currently a PhD candidate at the <a href = 'https://uva.computationalscience.nl/'>Computational Science Lab</a> within the Informatics Institute at the <a href = 'https://ivi.uva.nl/research/computational-science-lab-csl.html'> University of Amsterdam </a>, where I am supervised by Dr. <a href = 'https://vvvasconcelos.github.io/'>Vítor V. Vasconcelos</a> and Dr. <a href = 'https://mhlees.com/'>Michael Lees</a>. My research focuses on computational modeling of complex dynamical systems, with an emphasis on (mental) health systems. I also have a strong interest in causality, particularly in estimating causal graphs.
<br>
<br>
I completed my Master's in Methodology and Statistics at <a href='https://www.uu.nl'>Utrecht University</a>, where I worked on causal modeling, specifically estimating cyclic causal models using discovery algorithms, under Dr. <a href='https://ryanoisin.github.io/'>Oisín Ryan</a>. Prior to that, I studied <a href='https://psyres.uva.nl/content/research-groups/programme-group-psychological-methods/programme-group-psychological-methods.html?cb'>Psychological Methods</a> at the University of Amsterdam, where I learned about psychometrics, formal modeling of cognition, and Bayesian modeling. For my Bachelor's thesis, I explored the integration of variables with different time scales into a single network model and its impact on network density, supervised by Prof. Dr. <a href='https://dennyborsboom.com/'>Denny Borsboom</a> and Dr. <a href='https://cvborkulo.com/'>Claudia van Borkulo</a>.

<!-- When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me with a cup of coffee in hand, exploring new cafes around Amsterdam or snapping amateur photos of my dogs. I love wandering through national parks with them and checking out cute Dutch villages, especially during fruit-picking season. I’ll take a picture of just about anything—whether it’s a new travel spot or something random that catches my eye during the day!
