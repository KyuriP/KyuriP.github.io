<p class="consult">
I am generally interested in a broad range of topics related to statistics encompassing frequentist vs. Bayesian framework, statistical modeling (e.g., structural equation models, network models, multi-level models), and causal inference using graphical models.
I am always open to discussing any statistical problems regarding data analysis, visualization, and model estimation & interpretation.

If you have any trouble with your analysis and want to discuss, you can reach me at: <a href="mailto:k.park@uu.nl" target="_blank">k.park@uu.nl</a>.
