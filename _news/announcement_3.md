I took the <a href="https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2022-2023-en/search-course/course/102117">Network Analysis</a> course at University of Amsterdam. The course ran for about 8 weeks and it covered a lot in both theoretical and practical aspects. AS a final project, I together with Shannon worked on a cool mini-project on comparing Gaussian graphical models (GGM) with directed cyclic graph (DCG) models. I learned so much and I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in network models/network analysis.
